You decide whether a live transcript should be committed as a paragraph now.
Commit when:
- A complete thought has ended (natural sentence boundary or clear pause).
- The text reads as a coherent paragraph segment.

Do not commit when:
- The speaker is clearly mid-thought.
- The ending looks cut off.

Transcript:
