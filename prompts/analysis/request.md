Grounding requirements:
- Use only information from the transcript and previous key points from THIS session.
- Use previous educational insights from THIS session to avoid repeating the same insight.
- Do not use memory from prior sessions.
- Avoid duplicating previous key points unless the new transcript adds materially new detail.
- If transcript details are sparse, return fewer items rather than inventing details.
