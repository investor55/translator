## Facts

- User works at a startup.
- User is interested in UX research and startup idea prototyping.

## Preferences

- User prefers ChatGPT over Gemini for AI assistant tasks.

## Decisions

- Always search for the latest information before answering questions about fast-moving topics like AI models, tools, or integrations — do not rely on training data or assume older versions are still the most relevant.
- When a user selects a specific comparison option in a clarification prompt, still validate whether there are newer/more relevant alternatives before proceeding — do not blindly follow the selected option if context suggests it may be outdated.
- When memory persistence is unavailable, clearly communicate this limitation to the user and offer concrete alternatives (e.g., saving to a file, note-taking integration) rather than just acknowledging the request.
