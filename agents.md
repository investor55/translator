## Learned Workspace Facts

- The transcript context is from a COVID-19 (April/May 2020) Waipā District tourism sector briefing, discussing business impacts including hibernation/temporary closures, wage subsidy lobbying, and civil defence redeployment of tourism operators.
- Key tourism industry terminology used in this workspace: 'temporary seasonal closure' or 'hibernation' refers to businesses that closed for the first time due to COVID-19 (distinct from businesses that normally close seasonally); 'permanent closure' refers to businesses lost entirely to the tourism industry.
- Hobbiton is referenced as a high-profile tourism business in the Waipā District that made public media coverage for its COVID-19 closure.
- Lake Karapiro is identified as a key event platform/venue for the Waipā District.
- Support structure in the Waipā tourism context involves three layers: national/regional/local industry support (e.g. Tuwaka, Chambers of Commerce, business associations, local government), civil defence welfare support, and repurposing of tourism operators (caterers into food services/food banks, transport operators into essential worker transport, staff into security/call centres).
